* Interrogative:

      What — Asks to make a choice (in general).
      Whose — Asks who something belongs to.

“Which song will you play on your wedding day?”

“What pet do you want to get?”

“Whose child is this?”

* Frequency:

      Each — Every single one of a group (used to speak about group members individually).
      Every — Every single one of a group (used to make generalizations).
      Either — One between a choice of two.
      Neither — Not one or the other between a choice of two.
      Any — One or some things out of any number of choices. This is also used when the choice is irrelevant, like: “it doesn’t matter, I’ll take any of them.”
      
“Every rose has its thorn.”
I don't mind neither of them.

* Articles:

Although articles are their own part of speech, they’re technically also adjectives! Articles are used to describe which noun you’re referring to.

Simply put, when you’re talking about something general, use a and an. When you’re speaking about something specific, use the. “A cat” can be used to refer to any cat in the world. “The cat” is used to refer to the cat that just walked by.

Here’s a quick tip that can sometimes help you decide which article to use: Try using a demonstrative adjective before the noun. If it makes sense, use the word the. If it changes the meaning of what you’re trying to say, use a or an.

For example, if it makes sense to say “I don’t understand this question,” you can also say “I don’t understand the question.” On the other hand, it sounds strange to say “I need this tissue” because you don’t need that specific tissue. You just need “a tissue.”
